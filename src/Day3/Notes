Signature of a method 
		-- same argument , same datatype
		-- name of the method
		-- length of the argument
		-- return type
		-- datatype of the argument


when the child class has a method with the same signature as the method in the parent class
then the child class object always implement the method definition in its own class 
this is calling morphism through overriding
