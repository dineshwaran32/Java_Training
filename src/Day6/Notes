Collection is an interface that holds many inbuild or pre-build functions and methods to manipulate access,store and retrieve objects stored in an collection entity

collections are heterogeneous
treemap & treeset are heterogeneous


list  --arraylist , --linkedlist , --vector 
										~stack
										
										
set   --hashset 		, --sortedset , --navigableset (both sorted & navigable set implemented by preset)
		~linkedhashset			~ preset
		
	
queue  --priority queue , --blocking queue 
								~priority-blocking queue
								
								
map    --key value pair    
	-- hashmap   			--identity has map		       --sorted map					--hashtable (attribute file named properties)
		~linked hash map		~weak identity hashmap			~navigation map				~dictionary (both are legacy)
																  ~~tree map  
																
														
GC - Garbage collection		
		~ done by JVM
		~ mark and sweep algorithm
		~ in identify hash map calls to clear it asks to JVM and delete it but in weak identity hashmap when calls to clear the GC it clears without asking to JVM
		 		
vector (for old class)


sorting
	- natural order (comparable class)
	- user defined order (comparator class)
	
enumarator
  	- used for legacy classes (vector , dictionary , hashtable)
  	- goes forward only
iterator
	- goes both forward and backward
	- it was used to read but not delete because it dont know
list-iterator 
	- similar to iterator
	- remove element is possible
	- monstly used in list class

	
	
	


UTILITY CLASS
			-- like an abstract
			-- only store the method		 -> array
											/	
in collection there are 2 utility classes  -
											\
											 -> collection

collections are usally used as carrier objects hence they implement serializable and clonable by default
